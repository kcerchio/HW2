<h2>About Kyle</h2>
<p>I am 22 years old. I grew up in Naperville, IL and lived there my whole life. I attended Naperville Central High School
and graduated in 2011. I have only one other sibling who is a younger sister who attends Bradley University.
I enjoy sports such as football, baseball and basketball.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My first year of college I lived in Mayflower. My freshmen year I joined a fraternity here on campus.
My sopohmore year I decided to declare my major in BAIS. My dad was an influence as he owns his own 
infrastructure design company. My junior year I decided to study abroad in Rome and had the wonderful
opportunity to visit amazing countries. Hopefully I survive senior year and Software Design.  </p>
